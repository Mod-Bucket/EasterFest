EasterFest

A mod for Staxel.

==========

Easterfest is intended to be a multi-year festival. You can enjoy most of it right from the beginning, but some aspects of it won't unlock until you've advanced far enough to get high level crafting resources (At least pink tool level).

Most of the recipes are hidden and require experimentation. You can dig through the data files for the recipes if you're really stuck. The chickens will give you advice.

===========
Known bugs and workarounds:

* Alice and her dialogue isn't working correctly. She'll give you information but quests aren't implemented yet.  The other quest rewards she was intended to give you have been made accessible in other ways. The egg painter and a filligree food bowl have been added to the town square so you can use it. (Please, feel free to take them home with you! They were only put there so you have easy access to them while the quests are broken.)

* The Egg Painting bench isn't working at the moment. Lydocia should have a patch done soon.
It's possible to get all items in the mod in other ways (Mostly lucky boxes.) Crystal Eggs and the Wonder Egg are VERY SPECIAL. If you can't make them, DON'T sell them unless you've figured out how they work. Most items should be available in the catalog after you get them from lucky boxes. When you follow the chicken's instructions and unlock the Crystal and Wonder eggs you'll have access to everything in the mod (Eventually. It might take you a while to get it all.) Eggwood drop rates have been increased to compensate for the non-working eggpainter.
