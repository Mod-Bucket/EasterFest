EasterFest
Version 1.5.07

A mod for Staxel.

==========

Easterfest is intended to be a multi-year festival. You can enjoy most of it right from the beginning, but some aspects of it won't unlock until you've advanced far enough to get high level crafting resources (At least pink tool level).

It runs from Spring 6 to whenever you sleep on Spring 9.

May eggs should be placed on the ground and harvested like a mushroom or snail.

There are loads of secrets. Repeating quests give you random rewards, some rewards are very rare. 

Most of the egg decorating recipes are hidden and require experimentation. The chickens will give you advice, talk to them.

The only secrets that require being destructive are the Bobbleheads. Hints have (generally) been given for them, although they might be harder to suss out. If you've finished Farm Fan's bobblehead quest you might have an idea where to find two of them. The third can be found by listening to the chickens. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DIG.

Nearly every collectable egg can be crafted. One must be grown. Five are furniture you must find.

The end of this document has a list of all chicken dialogue in case you missed something. And after that is a cheat sheet for all the secret recipes if you're having trouble.

Wood does great things to eggs-pyo. Have you tried it all together-pyo?
If an egg looks like a thing you probably use that to make it-pyo. That should be obvious-pyo.
If you don't like breaking decorations, don't worry-pyo. Grow Eggwood-pyo.
We'll be back next year-pyo. You don't have to finish everything this year-pyo. Relax. Hop some. Hop.
Hop. One egg you have to grow-pyo. It might take a long time to get it-pyo.
Changing the number of petals you use can give you a different egg-pyo.
Things you can gather make interesting eggs-pyo. But you know that because you're smart-pyo.
Alice will give you three kinds of pets-pyo. But there are ways to make them too-pyo.
Rotate the Easter hedge to get different shapes-pyo. You can do that with most fences-pyo.
Set the May or April eggs down and then pick them like a mushroom to open them.
If you can scavenge it you can probably get an egg out of it-pyo. Hop.
Pets, Eggwood, and May eggs all give you different gifts-pyo. Get a lot of them if you're smart-pyo.
Use food on an egg at the combine table to try to hatch it-pyo.
Do you want to be a bunny person-pyo? Pets will give you a costume-pyo. Not enough-pyo? You can reincarnate as a leoporid in your next life-pyo.
Some eggs need more power than just a petal-pyo. Use a potion-pyo.
Hop. Hop. Can I be done now-pyo? Hop.
I am obligated to hop for you-pyo. Because I am a bunny-pyo. Hop. Hop.
