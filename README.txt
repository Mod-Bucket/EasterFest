Modbucket presents:

EasterFest
Version 1.2

A mod for Staxel.

==========

Easterfest is intended to be a multi-year festival. You can enjoy most of it right from the beginning, but some aspects of it won't unlock until you've advanced far enough to get high level crafting resources (At least pink tool level).

Most of the egg decorating recipes are hidden and require experimentation. The chickens will give you advice, talk to them.

===========
Known bugs and workarounds:

* Alice and her dialogue isn't working correctly. She'll give you information but quests aren't implemented yet.  The other quest rewards she was intended to give you have been made accessible in other ways. The filligree food bowl has been added to the town square so you can use it. (Please, feel free to take it home with you! It was only put there so you have easy access to it while the quests are broken. Once alice is working it will be removed and you'll have to wait until next year to get one if you didn't get it.)

	* Decorated Giant Chocolate and Giant Sugar Eggs have recipes now and can be bought in the catalogue.
	* Scorpions now very rarely drop from Filligree Rabbits.

Version 1.2
	* Microscopic correction to the Maze's X marks the Spot.
	* Added Cake Stand. Appears in the catalog from the start.
	* Fixed eggs so you can't buy them in the catalog and can't get them in lucky boxes. Make them or find them.
