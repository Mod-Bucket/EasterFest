EasterFest
Version 1.1

A mod for Staxel.

==========

Easterfest is intended to be a multi-year festival. You can enjoy most of it right from the beginning, but some aspects of it won't unlock until you've advanced far enough to get high level crafting resources (At least pink tool level).

Most of the recipes are hidden and require experimentation. You can dig through the data files for the recipes if you're really stuck. The chickens will give you advice.

===========
Known bugs and workarounds:

* Alice and her dialogue isn't working correctly. She'll give you information but quests aren't implemented yet.  The other quest rewards she was intended to give you have been made accessible in other ways. The egg painter and a filligree food bowl have been added to the town square so you can use them. (Please, feel free to take them home with you! They were only put there so you have easy access to them while the quests are broken. Once alice is working they will be removed and you'll have to wait until next year to get one if you didn't get it.)
