- "Hey, I've run out of painted easter eggs, can you help me? gather 10 eggs!"
- "Thanks for those eggs! Um, I can't find my dyes anywhere... Can you help me get some? 2 blue petals, 2 red petals, 2 green petals, and 2 white petals should do!"
- "Oh, now onto the fun part! Do you want to help me paint the eggs? Here's a painting station. Try it out! Bring me a red dyed egg, using 1 egg and 1 red petal."
