Introduction dialog:
Oh dear, oh dear...

	* Never met this festival:
	Oh! Hello, I'm Alice! Oh dear...

	* Already met this festival:
	Hi again! Oh dear...

-----------------------------------

Overview:
What's going on? Oh, lots of stuff! We're celebrating Easter!
There's egg collecting and egg decorating, and a maze, and there was supposed to be a tea party.

	* Tell me about collecting:
	There's a whole new collection for you! 
	And special prizes if you bring me decorated eggs.
	There are some where you'll find bugs or fossils,
	and of course, you'll find some hidden in the maze.
	For every # eggs you bring me I'll give you a prize!

	* Tell me about decorating:
	Oh! well, there's a special station that will let you make some of the eggs for the collection!
	If you bring me 3 regular chicken eggs I'll give it to you and show you how it works!

	* Tell me about the maze:
	Isn't it pretty? It's a little piece of home! 
	You can find decorated eggs and goodies in it! 
	There are all sorts of secrets! And there's a big prize if you make it to the center!
	
	* Tell me about the tea party: 
	Well it was supposed to happen soon, but I've managed to break my tea set! Can you find me another one?

--------------------------------------------------

Collecting Eggs Quest Chain:
	* Ten eggs! Already? Wow! You've definitely earned a reward!
	(Easter Bunny Farm Animal and Chocolate Egg to Chocolate Bar recipe.)
	He's convinced he's a chicken! Just humor him and give him chicken feed. He'll leave you chocolate eggs! I have more prizes if you can show me you've found another # eggs! Bring me ten more eggs for another prize!

	* Ten eggs! Amazing! You wanted a cute pet, didn't you? I have the perfect thing! 	
	(filligree rabbit, filligree rabbit food recipe, filligree food bowl, 1 blue ore.)
	It's a clockwork rabbit made by the best fairy filligree smiths! It's so lifelike! 
	Filligree needs magic ore to power it! Here's the recipe for the food and a chunk of ore to get you going until you can get more from the mining island. 
	Bring me ten more eggs for another prize!

	(This chain will loop infinitely, but you should only get any recipes the first time. Each time the filligree rabbit should change, but it shouldn't be random.)

--------------------------------------------------

Decorating Eggs Quest Chain:

	* Bring three eggs.
	Three eggs! Great! Ok. Here's your decorating station! And some recipes to get you started!
	(Decorating Station)
	WAIT! Don't run off yet!
	THIS.
	IS.
	IMPORTANT!
	There are lots and lots of eggs you can make! But most of them are a secret!
	You'll have to experiment! There are no recipes written down for you!
	Don't just try petals either! Try fruit or starbits, anything you can think of that might make a pretty egg! If it's an ingredient to make other things it might help you make a decorated egg!
	Have Fun!

	*Tell me about Decorating (after you have the station.)
	There are lots and lots of eggs you can make! But most of them are a secret!
	You'll have to experiment! There are no recipes written down for you!
	Don't just try petals either! Try fruit or starbits, anything you can think of that might make a pretty egg! If it's an ingredient to make other things it might help you make a decorated egg!
	Have Fun!

Maze Questline:

	*I found this Giant Golden Egg (after getting the egg from the center of the maze.)
	You did? Yay! Congratulations! Wasn't the maze fun? You can keep that for a decoration around your house, or sell it if you need the money.

	*I found this little Golden Egg (after finding the decorated golden egg.)
	Oh! It's pretty! But it's not the real prize!

	*I found this Rotten Egg (after finding the rotten egg.)
	Ew! Gross! That must have been from last year. I thought I smelled something...

------------------------------------------------

Tea Party Questline:

	*I found you a Tea Set (After getting a tea set either from maze or catalog)
	You did!? Oh, Thank you! 
	(Get random bit of easter furniture. Not the paw set, but stuff around the maze and square.)
	But... It's just... Oh dear...

	*What's wrong now?
	I managed to lose my easter basket! I know I had it when I went into the maze...

	*I found your basket!
	Marvellous! You're a lifesaver! 
	(Get random bit of easter furniture. Not the paw set, but stuff around the maze and square.)
	You must think I'm such a loon... Oh dear...

	* What's wrong now? (Start infinite loop)
	I broke the tea set again... It wasn't my fault this time! RANDOM_VILLAGERNAME bumped into me and well... Could you get me another?

	* I got you a new tea set!
	You did!? Oh, Thank you! 
	(Get random bit of easter furniture. Not the paw set, but stuff around the maze and square.)
	But... It's just... Oh dear...
			
	*What's wrong now?
	I'm missing all my egg fish! I think a cat got hungry.
	(Get random bit of easter furniture. Not the paw set, but stuff around the maze and square.)
	Could you go into the maze and catch me one?

	*I found an egg fish!
	Wow! They're so hard to catch!	
	(Get random bit of easter furniture. Not the paw set, but stuff around the maze and square.)
	...um... I hate to say it... (End infinite loop)
