Hello. I'm Mopsy-pyo. I am an Easter bunny-pyo. Hop. Hop. I feel ridiculous...pyo.
Wood does great things to eggs-pyo. Have you tried it all together-pyo?
If an egg looks like a thing you probably use that to make it-pyo. That should be obvious-pyo.
If you don't like breaking decorations, don't worry-pyo. Grow Eggwood-pyo.
We'll be back next year-pyo. You don't have to finish everything this year-pyo. Relax. Hop some. Hop.
Hop. One egg you have to grow-pyo. It might take a long time to get it-pyo.
I am obligated to hop for you-pyo. Because I am a bunny-pyo. Hop. Hop.


Hiya! Have you found any eggs yet? Squeak! Oh, no I was supposed to introduce myself! Click-click. I'm Flopsy.
Squeak! The prettiest eggs make petals and leaves. Or was it the other way 'round? Click-click.
The Great Golden Egg definitely cannot maybe be decorated. I think. Click-click. It's all so confusing.
Shells are so pretty next to eggs in my nest.
Easter pillars have a lot of pretty wisteria.
Stone eggs make pretty decorations.
Pretty things like me! ...wait that's not right... Click-click.


Thumpthumpthump! I'm Thumper! Who're you? Could you get this itch on my head? It's very annoying. Oh. Right there! Churrrrr...
Some eggs like to listen to music! Thumpthumpthump! I love the bass lines, myself!
Where there's treasure, there's a pirate. Thumpthumpthump! I should get myself a pegleg. Then I'd really thump!
Thumpthump! X marks the spot. Thump! Did you forget where the pirate was? Maybe next year.
Thumpthumpthump! Bushes are great places to hide! Underneath stone fences makes a good place for a burrow too. Churrr...
Princesses are pink and like red and white things. Thumpthumpthump!
You'll need three sets of three things to make the most magical egg. Thump! Potions are important!
Thumpthumpthump! It's not a party without magic lights! Chuurup!

Changing the number of petals you use can give you a different egg.
Eggplant acts like a purple petal for some eggs.
Mushrooms go well with eggs.
Red Lobster tastes best with blue petals.
Things you gather make interesting eggs.

Basalt and ores are worth a try.
Some fish turn silly colors when they eat petals.
